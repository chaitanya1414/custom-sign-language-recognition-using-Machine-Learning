# Custom Sign Language Recognition using Machine Learning

This project involves creating a custom sign language recognition system using hand landmarks detected via MediaPipe and a machine learning model. The system captures hand gestures, processes the landmarks, and trains a machine learning model to recognize these gestures.
In this project i have made random gestures which are not official sign language gestures and i made them only for fun purposeand trying out different stuff. I will also upload another repository which has actual hand sign gestures for different alphabets in some time.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Capture hand landmarks for custom sign language gestures.
2. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using the captured dataset.
3. **Real-Time Prediction**: Use the trained model to recognize gestures in real-time.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

## Installation

Use the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
